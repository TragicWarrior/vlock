  - GError

  - g_spawn?
  - string functions
  - memory allocation

medium
------

- generate error on invalid script
- document ./configure options better
- help distributors when vlock group is not avaiable at installation time
- plugin to ensure that vlock is run only once on a machine
- change the prompt timeout so it measures inactivity instead of the whole time
  to enter a password (this means even with a timeout of one second it would
  still be possible to authenticate)
